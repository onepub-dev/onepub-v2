/// Called by Critical Test when running unit tests

/// We ask the user to login using oauth as we can't do
/// it without user interaction.
/// The auth process has to use the standard token store as the
/// dart pub publish command can't be given an alternate token store.
///
/// As part of the auth process we need to know what user to tell
/// the user to login to.
/// This is taken from the test_settings.yaml file.
///
/// The onepub login process will update the .onepub/settings.yaml with
/// the logged in user details.
///
/// Ideally we don't want to affect the users normal environment so we should
/// write the details to an alternate settings.yaml.
///
/// Once the user has logged in we need to transfer the credentials to the
/// test_settings.yaml and discard the settings.yaml.
///
/// For subsequent unit tests we get the settings from test_settings and
/// transfer them into a tmp settings.yam.
///
/// All code that runs (including setup) needs to use a temp settings.yaml
/// as it will be the only one to have the correct details.
